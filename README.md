# Similar Car

A car comparison website which is built using a React front-end, with a Java / Spring-Boot backend and SQLite database.

The site is currently hosted on a free Heroku Dyno here, https://similar-car.herokuapp.com/
It is still a work in progress. As of now it has a simple VIN check for vehicles, and a couple of drop-downs populated with car data retrieved from some API's.
A car image API still needs to be found.

When completed the site will be hosted with AWS and will be deployed on the domain similarcar.com.
